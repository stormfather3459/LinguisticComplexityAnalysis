# LinguisticComplexityAnalysis

This program was written in my final year of university. It is a relatively simple project using Python and the NLTK package to analyse written language. 

The project comes preloaded with two csv files, they store speeches from the Irish Seanad from specific senators. This data was collected through the seanad API (https://data.oireachtas.ie/). These serve as examples, technically you could replace them with any other properly formatted CSVs that you want.

The main program is LexicalAnalysis.py and the main function currently prints out (after calculating) some metrics that serve as proxys for lexical and syntactic complexity. There was an accompanying essay/analysis submitted with this program for University but that is not included.
